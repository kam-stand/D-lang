# D-lang

This is a repository filled with code, notes and information I have either gathered or learned while reading the textbooküìó from this [link](http://ddili.org/ders/d.eenn/index.html). Essentially, this repository serves as a personal documentation of my journey learning :school_satchel: the D programming language

> I mainly code in C, Java, Python, and Bash. I came across D-lang randomly and I like that its statically typed, compiled and has the ability to manually manage memory.

## Structure of repository

Through my learning process I will try to be as neat and organized when going through the exercises and writing down notes, but the **general format** I have for this repository is each directory is essentially a chapter and the files are the exercises.

```

> :flushed: The info.txt and notes.md are just additional notes I took while doing some of the exercises.

---

> :exclamation: Beware that not all solution to the exercises for each chapter was done. Furthermore, not all chapter may be listed as they may have been combined to reduce reduncancy. Since, I mainly was reading and then coding I usually filled in the gaps of my knowledge with exercises that helped me better grasp certain concepts. If you want to find all solutions to exercises then the textbook linked in this repository has them at the end of each chapter.

## Resource Guide

Outside of the textbook, you will most likely need outside resources to help you along the way when stuck :confused: or have certain questions :question: pertaining to D-lang.

The most optimal way to learn is of course through the textbook. However, I have provided helpful links that can be used as a means to help you in your journeyüõ£Ô∏è.

> ‚ùó These links are from a wide variety of sources like Youtube to Discord thay may or may not expire

- [Discord Server](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://discord.com/invite/bMZk9Q4&ved=2ahUKEwiynsKdtuWLAxVkF1kFHXwAH9IQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1zoiFc4O1YBlynaTO-Ka81)
- [Forum ](https://forum.dlang.org/)

This is a youtube playlist from `Mike Shah` who essentially goes over the D programming language perfect for beginners like you and me! I found his videos more helpful after reading the textbooks and doing the exercises.

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS7X9ERdjM4&list=PLvv0ScY6vfd9Fso-3cB4CGnSlW0E4btJV)

> üö© There are plenty of other resources online that can be used to help you learn D-lang. The links mentioned above are essentially discussions, conversation and advice from more experienced developers within the D-lang community. A more **robust** and **definitive** resource is the D-lang official [website](https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html).

## Getting Started

If you want supplement your learning experience using this repository you're gonna need a couple things before you Started

1. D-lang Compiler - To run the actual D source files like `main.d` you will need a compiler which can be found using this [link](https://dlang.org/download.html)
   > :sunglasses: If you are on linux you can use the script or check the third party downloads for directions in regards to your specific distribution
2. Text editor or IDE
   - I used VScode and Gedit as my code editor but it does not matter what you choose just note that syntax highlighting, auto completion and other lang features are up to your disposal
   - In case you're wondering what extension I used for VScode its the following `webfreak.dlang-bundle`.
     > :information_desk_person: If this does not work then search for code-d and select the "D Programming Language (code-d)" extension from the list.
3. Version Control
   - You **WILL** make mistakes and its important to keep track of your progress so install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

  > ‚òùÔ∏è The check list above was actually produced using file I/O operations with the D-programming language. See `./stdin_stdou/info.txt` for more information on how it was done. Its a great way to see how concise and powerful the language is

# Topic reference

This is a table of certain concepts and summarized information I found useful when going though the textbook

| Topic   | Concept                  | Info                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Array   | slices                   | A slice is a portion of an array and is just the pointer + length                      |
| compile | flags                    | use the -run command as the final flag to immediately run the executable after compile |
| Array   | $                        | This is the same as array.length                                                       |
| Array   | slices and static arrays | a static array is passed by value, to change it needs to be slice or pointer           |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some of the tipcs and tricks may not be helpful at first because its just a concept. However, keep practicing

## Concepts

Some concepts I documented to help me better understand with demonstrations and examples

---

**Arrays**

```D
int[4] stat = [0, 1, 2, 3];
int[] statSlice = stat[];
assert(&stat[0] is statSlice.ptr); // true
```

> ‚úèÔ∏è The slice in this case is simply just the pointer to the beginning of `int [4] stat [ 0, 1, 2, 3]` `plus its length:4` which in turn means `statSlice.ptr + stat.length = stat.ptr + stat.length`. See `./arrays/slices.d` for more info.

---

**Compiler**

1. -wi `include warnings but dont treat them as errors`
2. -O3 :skull_and_crossbones: `aggressive optimization`
3. -run `Compile, link, and run the program srcfile with the rest of the command line, args..., as the arguments to the program. No .o or executable file is left behind.`

```sh
ldc2 -wi -O3 -run main.d
```

> :robot: The compiler of my choice was LDC it does seem to have better optimizations. The command above will equally work with `dmd` but the the `-O` flags are different for each compiler. The LDC compiler flags can be found running the command `ldc2 --help`


***

**lambda functions**

D lang supports lambda functions and they are extremely powerful considering how vast D lang.
- Using lambda functions offers a more shorter and concise syntax. Especially since you can have `local functions` inside of main funcionts

```d

    int [] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    int [] mult =  numbers.map!(n => n * 100).array();
    writeln(mult);
```
> :point_up: Notice how the lambda `n = > n * 100` has no name but this is also the same as `auto mult = (int a) => a * 100;`. The `.map!` comes from the `std.alogrithm` library and it it a template so I have to use `.array()` to make it an array return value. If I did not use `.array()` I could make the variable `mult` as auto.

***

**unit testing**
D lang has built in support for testing and its AWESOME. Its short sweet and very concise
> ‚ùó Testing is crucial in any software application. However, the **standard** unit test provided from D lang out of the box may or **may not be as extensive**. Therefore checkout these testing [frameworks](http://wiki.dlang.org/Libraries_and_Frameworks#Unit_Testing_Framework) for D-lang.
```sh

ldc2 -w -unittest main.d

./main 

```
