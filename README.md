## D-lang

- This is a repository filled with code, notes and information I have either gathered or learned while reading the text book from this link: ![link](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html).
- The directory translates to the chapters I have gone through. 
    - Some chapters may not appear or they have been combined into one directory for simplicity or to reduce redundancy
