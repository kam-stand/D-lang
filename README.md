# D-lang

This is a repository filled with code, notes and information I have either gathered or learned while reading the textbook📗 from this ![link](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html). Essentially, this repository serves as a personal documentation of my journey learning :school_satchel: the D programming language

## Structure

Through my learning process I will try to be as neat and organized when going through the exercises and writing down notes, but the general format I have for this repository is each directory is essentially a chapter and the files are the exercises.

> :exclamation: Not every folder will coincide to a direct mapping of the chapters in the textbook as I may have skipped over them or simply combined multiple, related, chapters together.
> The exercises are not explicitly mentioned within the `.d` files in each directory but rather simply implemented to the best of my ability. 

## Resource Guide

Outside of the textbook, you will most likely need outside resources to help you along the way when stuck :confused: or have certain questions :question: pertaining to D-lang.

The most optimal way to learn is of course through the textbook. However, I have provided links to a forum and a discord server that can be used as a means to help you in your journey🛣️.

> :exclamation: There are plenty of other resources online that can be used to help you learn D-lang. The links mentioned above are essentially discussions, conversation and advice from more experienced developers within the D-lang community.A more **robust** and **definitive** resource is the D-lang official ![link]([website ](https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html)).

## Getting Started

If you want supplement your learning experience using this repository you're gonna need a couple things before you Started

1. compiler 
- To run the actual D source files like `main.d` you will need a compiler which can be found using this !([link](https://dlang.org/download.html))
> :sunglasses: If you are on linux you can use the script or check the third party downloads for directions in regards to your specific distribution
2. text editor or ide
- I used VScode and Gedit as my code editor but it does not matter what you choose just note that syntax highlighting, auto completion and other lang features are up to your disposal
