## D-lang

- This is a repository filled with code, notes and information I have either gathered or learned while reading the textbooküìó from this ![link](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html).
- The directory translates to the chapters I have gone through. 
    - Some chapters may not appear or they have been combined into one directory for simplicity or to reduce redundancy 
    - Certain exercises may also not appear for the same reason as some chapters however, they may be in one program and may or not be explicitly mentioned


## Resource Guide

Outside of the textbook, can find the link in the description or above, you will most likely need outside resources to help you along the way when stuck or have certain question pertaining to D-lang.
The most optimal way to learn is of course through the textbook. However, I have provided links to a forum and a discord server that can be used as a mean to help you in your journeyüõ£Ô∏è.
