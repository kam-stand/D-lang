I used D-lang in this case to play with the file I/O operation and string utilities like append.
The file.txt is actually the list of chapters from the textbook copied and pasted which I then iterated over and appended '- [ ]' to the front.
I did this because instead of manually writing each check box for each chapter I used D-langs' simple to use syntax and appended it to each line corresponding to a chapter.
See the file_manipulation.d code to see how simple it was. This script was used to add the chapters into the README.

pseudocode:
1. open a file to read
2. open a file to write to
3. iterate until the end of the file
4. inside the loop read a line
5. create a string object
6. use the `~` keyword to append the string object and line
7. write to new file
8. loop ends 
9. close files
